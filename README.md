Camera.setLocation() for pre-android-9 sdks

## Build
This is an android library project. If you are using Eclipse(ADT), import this project as **Existing Android Code Into Workspace**, then build it. If you are using ant, run `ndk-build && ant release`. Either way, make sure you have android NDK environment.

**Note**: to use `ant` you need a `local.properties` file in the project.
```properties
# This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.
# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!
#
# This file must *NOT* be checked into Version Control Systems,
# as it contains information specific to your local configuration.

# location of the SDK. This is only used by Ant
# For customization when using a Version Control System, please read the
# header note.
sdk.dir={ANDROID_SDK_DIR}
```

## Usage
Copy the generated `classes.jar`(using ant) or *project_name*.jar(using eclipse) file under `bin` and `so` files under `libs`(with directory structure) into your android application project's `libs` directory.     
Use `com.zhcnxf.android.backports.graphics.Camera` the way you use `android.graphics.Camera`.
